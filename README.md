Welcome to Drew's Hangman game!

This is a fun word guessing game built entirely in JavaScript, HTML and designed with Sass. The game has 20 unique words to guess, all with unique hints to help you along the way


How to play:
To get started, press Start New Game and a game board will appear, showing the available letters needed to solve that puzzle. To input your guess, you can click in the inout box and either press the enter key or click the 'submit' button to register your guess. Be careful, only one letter allowed per guess! If you are stuck, you can click the hint button to receive a helpful hint about the word.

Once the word is guessed, you wil recieve a congratulatory message and then the game will start again with a new word!

At the bottom of the screen you will find a box that displays the available guesses you have left, as well as the letters that have already been guessed.

Good luck!

How this game was built:
The logic and components of the game have all been built in Vanilla JavaScript, and appending certain features using HTML. The game was lightly styled through Sass.
